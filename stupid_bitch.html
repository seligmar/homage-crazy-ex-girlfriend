<p>Well, Rebecca, you've done it now</p>
<p>Yeah, you guys know this one</p>
<p>Karma's come totap you on the shoulder</p>
<p>All the lying that's been festering</p>
<p>Plus breaking and entering</p>

<p>Is coming now to crush you like a boulder</p>

<p>And wants the world to burn</p>
<p>Bitch</p>
<p>You're a stupid bitch</p>
<p>And lose some weight</p>
<p>I was so close to Paradise</p>
<p>But now the only thing I'm close to is defeat</p>
<p>These shards are a metaphor for my soul</p>
<p>Won't stop the self-pity cause I'm on a roll</p>
<p>Yes, Josh completes me, but how can that be</p>
<p>When there's no me left to complete</p>

<p>And deceives the people she loves</p>
<p>Now he knows I'm not some innocent lamb</p>
<p>He sees me for</p>
<p>what I am</p>
<p>Which is a</p>
<p>horrible,</p>
<p>stupid,</p>
<p>Dumb and ugly,</p>
<p>fat and stupid,</p>
<p>simple self-hating</p>
<p>Bitch!</p>
