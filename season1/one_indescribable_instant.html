  In one indescribable instant The whole world falls away In one indescribable
  instant You'll know just what to say In one indescribable instant Your heart
  will speak the truth 'Cause in that one indescribable, Magical, mystical,
  endless, incredible instant The only words you'll need are I love you In one
  indescribable instant There is no time or space In one indescribable instant
  It all falls into place In one indescribable instant Your dreams will all come
  true 'Cause in that one indescribable, magical, mystical, endless, Incredible,
  barely believable, truly unlikely, But not inconceivable, what, Are you
  kidding me, no, it's for real-able instant The only words you'll need are I
  love you
